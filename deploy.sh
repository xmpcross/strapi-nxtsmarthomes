# Because the working tree IS production, an uncommitted edit goes live the
# moment this runs. That is deliberate -- it makes previewing local changes
# cheap -- but a half-finished edit ships too, so the script refuses to build a
# dirty tree unless you pass --allow-dirty.
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are inlined at BUILD time, not read at runtime, so
# .env.local must be correct here and not only in the systemd unit.
